## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   cd workspace-blank
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Express server and make the API available at `http://localhost:3000`.
